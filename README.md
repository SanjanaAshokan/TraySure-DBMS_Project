TraySure: Smart Restaurant Management System
TraySure is a web-based platform built with PHP, MySQL and HTML/CSS to help restaurants track ingredients, manage stock, and reduce food waste. 
It monitors ingredient quantities, expiry dates, and daily usage, and automatically calculates monthly losses. 
The system also supports food donation of surplus stock, login-based access control, and detailed monthly and yearly summaries, giving restaurants better cost control, inventory insights, and sustainability.
